Howdy!

This here's my repo for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2022.

I first learned about AoC last year and used it as way to practice writing in Go.

This year, having landed firmly in the camp of Emacs (church of Emacs? (I guess it depends who you ask)) by way of [Doom](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs), I figured it's about time I learn some lisp (famous last words).

I'll be posting my code after completing each day's puzzle (so long as I don't drown in all these parentheses (though, I've neve been one to shy away from a good nested parenthetic phrase (something I might never do after this event))).
I'm not aiming for elegance or performance, though I am hoping to do things more-or-less the Lisp Way if I can.

(was (now, where) I), oh, right drowning in parentheses.

Helping me along the way, (aside from [SO](https://stackoverflow.com/) of course), is [Practical Common Lisp](https://gigamonkeys.com/book/). I've found it strikes a good balance between brevity and depth (handy in a crash course) and has excellent and extensive examples to augment the explanations.

And that's pretty much it.

So, good luck to all participating, Happy Advent and Merry Christmas! *cheers!*
